# 3D Rotation and Inverse Kinematics

This repository provides Python implementations to:

- Generate and visualize 3D rotation matrices around X, Y, and Z axes.
- Combine multiple rotations into a single transformation.
- Verify rotation matrix properties (determinant and inverse).
- Solve 2D inverse kinematics for a 2-link robotic arm.
- Plot 3D vectors to visualize rotations.

## Features

1. **Rotation Matrices**
   - Rotation around X, Y, and Z axes.
   - Matrix verification: determinant and transpose/inverse check.
   - Combine multiple rotations for complex transformations.
   - 3D visualization using Matplotlib.

2. **Inverse Kinematics**
   - Compute joint angles for a 2-link planar robotic arm.
   - Checks for unreachable target points.
   - Output in radians (can be converted to degrees if needed).

3. **Visualization**
   - Plot rotated coordinate axes.
   - Observe combined rotations in 3D space.
  
## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
